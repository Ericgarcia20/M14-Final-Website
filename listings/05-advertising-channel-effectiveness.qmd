#### **Overview**

This analysis explores how advertising investments across various channels (such as TV, Google Ads, Social Media, and more) impact product sales. By visualizing spending patterns and running a predictive model, we identify the most influential marketing strategies driving performance.

### **Data-set Used**

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
# Data
data <- read.csv("Advertising_Data.csv")
```

```{r}
# Correlation Heatmap
corr_matrix <- cor(data)
corrplot(corr_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)
```

Description: This heatmap visualizes the pairwise correlation between all advertising channels and product sales. A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, while values close to -1 suggest a strong negative relationship. This plot helps identify which advertising investments are most closely related to higher product sales.

Use Case: Quickly assess which channels might be more effective in influencing product performance.

```{r}
# Scatter Plots
data_long <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -Product_Sold, names_to = "Channel", values_to = "Spend")

ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Spend, y = Product_Sold)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "#0073C2FF") +
  facet_wrap(~ Channel, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Advertising Spend vs. Product Sold", x = "Advertising Spend", y = "Product Sold")
```

Description: This set of scatter plots displays the relationship between spending in each advertising channel and the number of products sold. Each plot shows how variations in spending may correspond to sales volume for that specific channel.

Use Case: Visually inspect trends, patterns, or outliers for each advertising medium and how it might drive sales.

```{r}
# Multiple Linear Regression
model <- lm(Product_Sold ~ ., data = data)
data$Predicted_Sales <- predict(model, data)

ggplot(data, aes(x = Product_Sold, y = Predicted_Sales)) +
  geom_point(color = "#EFC000FF", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Actual vs. Predicted Product Sales", x = "Actual Sales", y = "Predicted Sales")
```

Description: This plot compares the actual number of products sold to the values predicted by a linear regression model using all advertising channels as predictors. The dashed red line represents a perfect match between predicted and actual sales.

Use Case: Evaluate the overall predictive accuracy of your regression model and assess how well advertising spend explains sales performance.
